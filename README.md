## Aspiring Front-End Developer & Passionate Musician

I'm currently deep into my journey at Noroff, where I'm wrapping up my first year and eagerly anticipating the second. Coding has become more than just a study, it's a canvas for my creativity.

### ü•Å & üíª About Me:
- I recently developed a [Drumming Blog Website](https://taupe-medovik-72ed9d.netlify.app/), a project that resonates with my dual love for rhythm and code.
- When I'm not immersed in coursework, I'm exploring the synergies of Vue.js and Next.js.
- Drumming isn't just a hobby, it's a part of who I am. Catch the beat with my band, [Main Street Revival](https://www.msrbandofficial.com/).
- Open to collaboration and opportunities, let's connect: [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/christian-almli-4b82b8196) or via email (chrisalm97@gmail.com).
